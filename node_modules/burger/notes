- have a `scheduleUpdate` action and then allow changes to be added to a queue
- have find/where actions return a new collection object that still responds to finder type methods
- should register parent with child when new html is rendered to the page?
- figure out way to watch for dom inserts
- live binding
- see if it can work with remote JS calls
